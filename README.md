1. Write a program, which reads number of students and n grades as input (of int
between 0 and 100, inclusive) and displays the average, minimum and maximum.Your
program shall check for valid input. You should keep all the grades in an int[] and use a
method for each of the computations.
Output:
Enter the number of students: 4
Enter the grade for student 1: 86
Enter the grade for student 2: 65
Enter the grade for student 3: 98
Enter the grade for student 4: 77

The average is 81.50
The minimum is 65
The maximum is 98

2. Write a program to list all the factorials, that can be expressed as an int (i.e., 32-bit
signed integer). Your output shall look like:
Int Factorials:
The factorial of 1 is 1
The factorial of 2 is 2
..........
The factorial of 12 is 479001600
he factorial of 13 is out of range
Modify your program and add a method called longFactorial to list all the factorial that can
be expressed as a long (64-bit signed integer).The maximum value for long is kept in a
constant called Long.MAX_VALUE.
your output shall look like:
Long Factorials:
The factorial of 1 is is 1.
The factorial of 2 is is 2.
..........
The factorial of 20 is is 2432902008176640000.
The factorial of 21 is out of range.

3. Write a program to find all files of a folder and select only given extention fileName and
read content of this file using byte array
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Write a program to calculate the frequency of the words in a given file,

Example: Create a file named FileDemo.txt with the following content
i am a man ,
i like to sleep ,
i have a home.

Output: 
i->3 times,
am-1,
like -1,
have -1,
a-2 etc.,
